# ML-Heart-disease-Detection
here is a detailed explaination on my thought process during the development of this model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all I had to understand the unique samples I had in the data and further understand the data in order to select the best type of models that can do the greatest job with this type of data. I quickly identified that we need a classification model since we have a target column which is labeled ‘target’ in the actual data, moreover, the data from the medical field is usually needed for disease identification which requires mostly classification models. Then i started getting my hands dirty by applying data preprocessing techniques on the dataset before feeding it into the Machine Learning models such as Data Scaling, handling nulls , detecting and handling outliers, etc.. .Furthermore, i trained classification models like Knn, logistic regression, trees and random forrest models on this supervised Dataset in order to identify the best prediction model for heart diseases. Then I used multiple accuracy testing methods such as cross validation in order to know how well different models performed with this kind of data. Additionally, I used methods like confusion matrix to see if overfitting occurred or not by these models, and at the end I chose the best model with the best hyper-parameter that worked with these types of features. In this case it was the Knn model with 3 neighbors hyper-parameter worked the best without overfitting. While other algorithms such as random forrest and logistic regression showed higher accuracy levels than the knn model but they showed some signs of overfitting.
